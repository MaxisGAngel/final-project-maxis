              <h2>Description:</h2>
              <p> The dorm rooms are best for those who don't want to be living in a shared living area with set people, people who want to have their own space. You need to be comfortable with sharing a communal bathroom and common area. Potentially these rooms are best for people who go out a lot, so then you wont trap yurself in your room constantly. These are also good for those who don't want to share a living space with a group of people in their first year. </p>

                <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p> The apartment rooms are best for those who want to live in a flatting-type space, prior to going flatting for real the year after. The apartmenst are also a good idea if you want to help build you communal living skills, and it makes it a lot easier to find people to talk to. I would suggest that you are someone who can or is willing to communicate with others, and would be someone to respect others, as well as being someone who is prepared to potentially host a few parties.</p>

          <h2>Deluxe + Studio rooms</h2>
          <p>I do not have details on the deluxe or studio rooms, as I have only visited those a few times at the beginning of the year.
          Essentially these rooms are extra large dorm rooms, with a double sized bed, with your own kitchen and bathroom.
