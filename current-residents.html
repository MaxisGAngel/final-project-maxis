                People are naturally biased whether we want to be or not, so I have collected a few other residents to talk honestly about Te P&amacr; Tauira Otago Polytechnic Student Village. <br> <br>

                  <Strong>Do you like Te pa? - Why/not</Strong>
                  <br>
                  Z: Its okay. I like the setting, the apartments and lovely wooden moden look. However I do think there is a lack of community. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is your favourite part?</Strong>
                    <br>
                  Z: My friends and apartment with the cool window view! I will also say i love the Te Pa location. The gym, shops, uni and big grass fields make you feel like your not really in the midle of central city which I like.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is your least favourite?</Strong>
                    <br>
                  Z: the people and lack of community. Everyone is in their groups and that is that.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Are activities good?</Strong>
                    <br>
                  Z: Some of them yes,but there is a real lack in organisation. Sometimes i'd rather thy do a higher quality activity every second Tuesday, than each week.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Is the food good?</Strong>
                    <br>
                 Z: Most of the time yes, but there's a few times where it is just contant meat and vege.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Who would you recommend this accommodation for?</strong>
                  <br>
                  Z: First year students who want to live close to school, but also those who like to be social and party would be more suited. </p>

                    <Strong>Do you like Te pa? - Why/not</Strong>
                    <br>
                    M: I do actually, it's very nice, newly built, and I personally like it more than Salmond.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What is your favourite part?</Strong>
                      <br>
                    M: The people I've met here, and how nice the rooms are!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>What is your least favourite?</Strong>
                      <br>
                    M: My neighbour has a really annoying alarm that he sleeps through, but I can hear it…
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Are activities good?</Strong>
                      <br>
                    M: yes there is a good variety, a mixture of sports, crafts, trips, food and relaxation activities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Is the food good?</Strong>
                      <br>
                    M: I really enjoy the food most days, some nights aren't as great as others, but they provide heaps of extra options. The drinks are also good!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Who would you recommend this accommodation for?</strong>
                    <br>
                    M: I recommend this hall for people who want to be close to school and easily accessible to the city. If you want a modern space with amazing bedrooms this is really good, and if you want the option of being in an apartment, as Salmond (the other Otago Polytechnic accommodation option) has not great bedrooms, although it does have morevariety in there common space, and an outdoor area. </p>
